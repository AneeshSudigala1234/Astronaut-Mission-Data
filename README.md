# Astronaut Mission Data

### **Overview**

**This repository was created for Professor Gotzler's ENGL 105-075 class in the Fall 2024 semester at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.**

It contains the [Raw Data](https://github.com/AneeshSudigala1234/Astronaut-Mission-Data/blob/main/Data/raw_data.csv) and the [Archive](https://github.com/AneeshSudigala1234/Astronaut-Mission-Data/blob/main/Data/final_data.csv) of data that was created by manipulating the raw data using Python. 

This repository also includes the [Python Notebook](https://github.com/AneeshSudigala1234/Astronaut-Mission-Data/blob/main/processdocumentation.ipynb) that can be used to replicate the archive. That file documents the process for crafting the archive of data from the raw data.
